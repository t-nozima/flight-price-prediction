#ðŸ›« Flight Price Prediction using Machine Learning

âœ¨ Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting flight ticket prices based on various factors such as airline, departure time, number of stops, and more. Using a Random Forest Regressor, we develop a model that accurately estimates flight ticket prices based on historical data.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and performed feature selection.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized feature correlations and analyzed important factors affecting flight prices.
Machine Learning Model: Implemented a Random Forest Regressor for price prediction.
Performance Evaluation: Measured model accuracy using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score.
Final Submission: Generated predictions and formatted them for submission.
ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset includes flight details from March to June 2019 in India, covering:

Airline (e.g., IndiGo, Air India)
Source & Destination Cities
Departure & Arrival Time
Number of Stops
Class (Economy/Business)
Days Left for Departure
ðŸš€ Technologies Used

Python
Pandas & NumPy â€“ Data manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ Data visualization
Scikit-learn â€“ Machine learning & model evaluation
ðŸ“Š Model Performance

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2066.37
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 15,484,335.83
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 3935.01
